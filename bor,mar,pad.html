        CSS BOX MODEL :- 
    </header>
    <BR>
        <MAIN> 
            The CSS Box Model describes how elements are rendered as rectangular boxes on a webpage, defining their dimensions and spacing. It consists of four distinct areas, layered from the innermost to the outermost:
Content Box:
This is the innermost area where the actual content of the element resides, such as text, images, or other media. Its dimensions are typically controlled by the width and height CSS properties.
Padding Box:
Surrounding the content box is the padding box. This transparent space acts as a buffer between the content and the element's border. The padding property controls its size, and the element's background is visible through the padding area.
Border Box:
The border box encloses both the content and padding, providing a visual boundary around the element. Its appearance (style, width, color) is determined by the border properties.
Margin Box:
The outermost layer is the margin box, which creates a transparent space outside the border. This margin separates the element from other elements on the page. The margin property controls its size, and it is always transparent, allowing the background of the parent element to show through.
